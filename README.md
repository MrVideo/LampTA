# Sample Lamp project in UPPAAL

This repository contains a tiny project which aims to model a lamp and its button with a Network of Timed Automata through the [UPPAAL](https://uppaal.org/) tool.

I made this as a reference for myself, but you are free to use the code as you wish.

## Attribution

The model found in this project was taken from [this paper](https://uppaal.org/texts/new-tutorial.pdf), while the traces, simulations and queries were made by me afterwards.
